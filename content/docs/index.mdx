## What is Zeta?

Zeta is an open-source platform designed to help you distribute, manage, and protect UI components—especially those built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Whether you want to share components publicly or securely distribute premium assets, Zeta provides a modern, developer-friendly solution.

## Key Features

- **Component Registry**: Centralized source for shadcn/ui components, supporting both open and protected (licensed) distribution.
- **License Key Integration**: Secure access to premium/private components with license key validation (Polar.sh integration).
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for a responsive, accessible interface.
- **Extensible & Modular**: Easily integrate authentication, deployment, and more.
