## Introduction

Zeta is a standard Next.js application. You can deploy it to any platform that supports Next.js. Official testing and support is provided for Vercel. Netlify is also supported, but may require additional configuration.

## Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your project to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and import your repository.
3. Vercel will detect the Next.js app automatically. Use the default build settings unless you have custom requirements.
4. Set the required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (`REGISTRY_TOKEN_SECRET`, `POLAR_ORG_ID`, `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, etc.).
5. Deploy the project.

For more details, see the [Vercel Next.js documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs).

## Deploying to Netlify

1. Push your project to a Git repository.
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com/) and create a new site from your repository.
3. Set the build command to `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`, depending on your setup).
4. Set the publish directory to `.next`.
5. Set the required environment variables in the Netlify dashboard.
6. Deploy the project.

For more details, see the [Netlify Next.js documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/).

## Other Platforms

Zeta can be deployed to any environment that supports Next.js. Refer to the [official Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more options and advanced configuration.

## Notes
