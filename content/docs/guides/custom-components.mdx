## Introduction

This guide explains how to create and register a custom UI component in Zeta. It is intended for developers who want to add their own components to the registry, either for private or public use.

## Prerequisites

- Zeta project set up
- Access to shadcn/ui
- pnpm installed
- Familiarity with React and TypeScript

## Recommended Structure

Place your custom components in the `registry` directory at the project root (referred to as `@registry`).
Organize related files (component, styles, documentation) within the same directory for clarity.

## Creating a Custom Component

1. **Create the file**
   - Example: `MyComponent.tsx` inside the appropriate namespace folder within `registry` (e.g., `registry/new-york/ui/MyComponent.tsx`).
2. **Define the component**
   - Use a functional React component with TypeScript.
   - Example:

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface MyComponentProps {
  label: string;
}

export function MyComponent({ label }: MyComponentProps) {
  return <div className="p-4 font-medium">{label}</div>;
}
```

3. **Add props and logic**
   - Define clear, typed props.
   - Keep logic simple and reusable.
4. **Apply styles**
   - Use Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui primitives for styling.
5. **Document the component**
   - Add a short comment or MDX file describing usage and props.

## Registering the Component in Zeta

Add your component to the `registry.json` file in your namespace within the `registry` directory. Follow the official schema. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-component",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "title": "My Component",
  "description": "A simple custom component.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "dependencies": ["react"],
  "files": ["ui/MyComponent.tsx"]
}
```

## Testing and Validation

- Import and use your component in an example page or test file.
- Ensure it renders correctly and props work as expected.
- Check that it appears in the registry and is accessible as intended.

## Additional Notes

- Do not use `shadcn build`. Zeta manages the build and distribution process.
- For details on the registry schema, see [registry.json documentation](/docs/configuration/registry-json).
- Protect premium components as needed using the middleware and license system.
