## Introduction

This guide explains how to protect non-public (private or premium) components in Zeta. The process is similar to creating custom components, with additional considerations for access control and distribution.

## Registering Protected Components

- Protected components can be registered in a separate `registry.json` file within your `registry` directory, as long as the file follows the official schema. See the [registry.json documentation](/docs/configuration/registry-json) for details.
- You may organize public and protected components in different namespaces or directories as needed.

## Build and Distribution

- **Public components:** You can use `shadcn build` to generate and distribute public components.
- **Protected components:** For any non-public components, do not use `shadcn build`. Zeta manages the build and distribution process to ensure proper access control and license enforcement.

## Access Control

- Zeta uses middleware and license validation to restrict access to protected components. Ensure your middleware is configured as described in the [middleware guide](/docs/configuration/middleware).
- Only users with a valid license or token will be able to access protected components.

## Best Practices

- Always follow the official schema for all `registry.json` files.
- Keep public and protected components organized and clearly separated.
- Refer to the [registry.json documentation](/docs/configuration/registry-json) for schema details and examples.
